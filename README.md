This repository contains the research platform which was created at George Mason University's GATE Lab to investigate
the use of formal verification tools for logic locking deobfuscation.

The source code is released under a BSD-3-Clause license as basis for further research. More information on usage and
installation of this tool could be found in the [wiki](/gate-lab/RANE/wiki) page.

# Report

You can learn more about this tool in our paper which explains how we adapted formal verification tools to find the key
inputs of logic locked circuits.
